Overlap2D is a 2D level and UI editor with an engine agnostic philosophy for game development.
Made to separate coding from content, it enables developer to create rich content using images,
animations, particle effects, light system, physics and complex grouped items.

### Getting Started

* [Check out our website](http://overlap2d.com/)

### Runtime
Overlap2D currently supports [libGDX](https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx) based runtime which will easily render your content on
Android, iOS and desktop, while letting you code on Java.
It is of course open source: [overlap2d-libgdx-runtime](https://github.com/UnderwaterApps/overlap2d-runtime-libgdx)
Runtimes for other platforms are coming soon and everyone is welcome to contribute!

### Project Set-Up to run from sources (we'll make it easier later)
Here are the steps you need to do in order to run this project from sources

* Fork this repo
* Clone your fork to your local
* Overlap2D requires for it to be in same folder in which o2d runtime and spine runtime are located so you need to clone them separately
* Clone overlap2d-runtime from [here](https://github.com/UnderwaterApps/overlap2d-runtime-libgdx) (and switch it to dev branch)
* Clone spine runtimes from [here](https://github.com/EsotericSoftware/spine-runtimes)
* Make sure that paths are correct by taking a look (not modifying) settigs.gradle of overlap2d project
* Open your favorite IDE (Eclipse/IntelliJ) and import overlap2d as gradle project
* Things should work fine now, create branch, make some commits, push it to your origin and make some pull requests - yay ^^

### Reporting Issues
Because the editor is now open source, you can use the [issue tracker](https://github.com/UnderwaterApps/overlap2d/issues?page=1&state=open) here on GitHub to report issues.
